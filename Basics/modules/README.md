Each module or python file creates a namespace around its declared name
A namespace is an enclosure that protects the names declared as variables or function names in the python file

A package is a directory of modules i.e. folder of python files
A directory is declared as package by creating a __init__.py file inside the folder

__init__.py is executed by python directly whenever a program imports that directory for the first time
